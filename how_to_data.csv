If you have subtasks with multiple parent tasks and any one of those is part of a dependency chain, none of the subtask’s parent tasks will expand. Milestones Milestones, by definition, can only be scheduled for a due date (one day).

If aligning the subtask with one parent task pushes it outside the scope of another parent task, then you won’t see the alignment option.  Dependencies Dependent task chains have their own alignment logic. If the task is linked to its subtasks via a dependency, then only normal dependency chain rules apply - task dates can shift but you will not be asked to align dates.

To include weekends in the task duration: Open the task in the Task view. Click the “Set Date” button or the dates, for which the task is to be scheduled. Uncheck the “Working days only” option (located at the bottom of the scheduling pop-up). Non-working days and vacations are also factored in when you reschedule a task. If you drag the task or change the task start/end date(s), and the assignee has vacation or non-working days planned in that period, you will see the number of days off affecting the task’s duration near the assignee’s name. If you change the task start/end dates from the Table or from within the expanded task, the non-working days and vacations will be deducted from the total duration of the task. "

Even a 1 day delay to Task J would push out the Project’s finish date, therefore it’s a part of the Critical Path.

Here’s why: Task H now ends immediately prior to Task J (there’s no gap between them). Task H is also connected to Task J via a finish to start dependency.
